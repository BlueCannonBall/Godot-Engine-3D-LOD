Simply add the lod.gd and icon.svg files (in the same directory) to a Godot project to use the new LOD node extending from Spatial. Tweak the values in the editor to achieve the intended result. Please note that the LOD does not work in editor, and the original visibility of the LODs does not affect runtime.
